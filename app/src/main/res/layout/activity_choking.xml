\n•Slap it out: If coughing doesn't work, help the casualty bend forward.\n
Use the heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades.
\nCheck their mouth to see if there's anything in there and, if there is, get them to pick it out.
\n•Squeeze it out: If back blows don't work, give up to five abdominal thrusts. Stand behind them.
\nLink your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest, with your lower hand clenched in a fist.
\nPull sharply inwards and upwards.
\n•Call for Help: Call for an ambulance or any other medical help.
\nIf they become unresponsive at any stage, open their airway and check their breathing.
\nIf they're not breathing, start chest compressions and rescue breaths (CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to try to release whatever's stuck in there. "
